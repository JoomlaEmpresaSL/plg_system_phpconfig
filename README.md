# PHPconfig for Joomla
PHPconfig for Joomla! is a developer website tool to help to locate errors in Joomla websites. PHPconfig modifies several parameters of the PHP (only if the configuration of your server allows it). Multi-version: Joomla 1.5 and Joomla 2.5 and Joomla 3

* Allows you to change the maximum time of execution.
* Modify PHP memory limit.
* Show or hide the notification of errors of the PHP (and the level of detail of the same).
* You can choose where the plug-in works (front-end, back-end or both)
* Finally, you can define which IP addresses can execute this plug-in.

You can use this function to locate errors in a website in production, as if you change the general configuration of the Joomla to show errors, all the visitors will see the errors, but with PHPconfig plug-in you can choose the IPs that will see the errors, or use another PHP memory limit. Besides, this plug-in also can serve for users that only want to modify the PHP parameters of their Joomla website.
